I want to create a to-do react app 
The app is using react.js, firebase cloud as a database for example, and use a suitable backend.

    -The user can sign up/sign in which uses the database
    -Each user has his own to-do list
    -The user can see the completed tasks that he has done
    -The tasks are saved to the database
    -A beautiful and friendly user interface/user experience
